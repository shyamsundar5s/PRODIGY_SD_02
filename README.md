# Guessing Game
A simple Python command-line game where you try to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100.

## How to Play
1. The program selects a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You will be prompted to enter your guess.
3. After each guess, you'll be told if your guess is too low, too high, or correct.
4. The game continues until you guess the correct number.
5. At the end, the program will tell you how many attempts it took to guess the number correctly.
